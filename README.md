# fam_repo2
This project is a repository based application designed to store family artifacts for a client. It can be extended easily to ios but currently works only for android devices.
This project was dwvwloped by Team "The Bug" as a capstone project for "COMP30003 IT Project" in the University Of Melbourne.
It is a platform for families to store their memories and artefacts like memorabilia and important documents.

The app has the following capabilities:
1) The user can take a picture and use some pre-loaded filters and crop the images as well and upload it.
2) The user can also record voice memos and upload them directly.
3) The user can write in the in-built text editor and upload it.
4) The user has the ability to post or keep things private. Also a user can send these artifacts to any individual family members.
5) A person can have multiple families for example this app can be used by a group of friends as well.
6) A person can share thier post externally via whatsapp, google drive etc.


Things we would like to work on if given more time:
1) We were not able to add the comments capability where people can comment on each others post.
2) "Memories" functionality in which the user can see his memories from particular days in the past. 
3) Make it prettier.
